- **Visual Distinction**: Owner badges use highlight color for prominence, joined badges use accent color for secondary status
- **Race Management**: Race creators automatically tracked when creating races, enabling proper ownership display throughout app
- **Maintained Accessibility**: All race cards remain tappable for viewing details regardless of join status, ensuring users can always access race information for reference

## ✅ **Version 1.11 - Compilation Fixes, Enhanced UX & Navigation (COMPLETED)**

### **Critical Compilation Error Resolution**
**Implementation**: Resolved blocking compilation errors preventing app build and testing
- **DragGesture Translation Fix**: Corrected `dragValue.translation.y` to `dragValue.translation.height` in RaceHubView.swift:1208
  - Root cause: DragGesture.Value.translation returns CGSize (with .height), not CGPoint (with .y)
  - Applied fix across all drag gesture implementations for consistency
- **MyJoinedRaceCard Cleanup**: Removed erroneous `hasJoined` variable references in lines 1899 and 1901
  - These were remnants from refactoring since MyJoinedRaceCard only displays already-joined races
  - Eliminated redundant conditional logic that was causing compilation failures
- **Parameter Naming Consistency**: Standardized drag gesture parameter naming from `value` to `dragValue` for clarity

### **Enhanced Keyboard Dismissal System**
**Implementation**: Comprehensive keyboard dismissal functionality across all text input interfaces
- **Universal hideKeyboard() Function**: Added shared keyboard dismissal using `UIApplication.shared.sendAction(#selector(UIResponder.resignFirstResponder))`
- **Tap-Outside-to-Dismiss**: Implemented background tap gestures that detect clicks outside text fields
- **Swipe-Down-to-Dismiss**: Added downward swipe gesture recognition with 50px minimum threshold for intentional dismissal
- **Targeted Implementation**: Applied to all views with text input:
  - **AllRacesView**: Search bar keyboard dismissal for race discovery
  - **CreateRaceView**: Form field keyboard management for race creation  
  - **SoloTrainingView**: Training parameter input keyboard handling
- **Smart Gesture Logic**: Gestures only active on views containing active text input fields

### **Home Screen "Your Upcoming Races" Enhancement**
**Implementation**: Prominent upcoming races card matching Featured races styling and functionality
- **Conditional Display**: Card only appears when user has upcoming joined races (`!userData.upcomingJoinedRaces.isEmpty`)
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches Featured races card design with identical typography, spacing, and layout
- **Data Integration**: Uses `userData.upcomingJoinedRaces` with 5-race limit (`Array(userData.upcomingJoinedRaces.prefix(5))`)
- **Required Heading**: Displays "Your upcoming races" as specified for clear section identification
- **Navigation Integration**: "View All" button uses enhanced TabSwitcher navigation to My Races section
- **Horizontal Scroll Layout**: Identical to Featured races with `RacePreviewCard` components for visual consistency
- **Strategic Placement**: Positioned after Featured races section to promote user's committed races

### **Enhanced TabSwitcher Navigation System**
**Implementation**: Extended tab navigation to support sub-section targeting within tabs
- **RaceTab Section Control**: Added `@Published var raceTabIndex: Int = 0` to TabSwitcher for race section tracking
- **Enhanced Navigation Method**: New `switchToRaceTab(section: Int = 0)` method for precise section targeting
  - Method simultaneously sets target race section and switches to Race tab (index 2)
  - Supports navigation to specific sections: Featured (0), All Races (1), My Races (2), Create Race (3)
- **RaceHubView Integration**: 
  - Removed local `selectedTab` state variable to prevent navigation conflicts
  - Added `@EnvironmentObject var tabSwitcher: TabSwitcher` for global navigation control
  - Picker and TabView now bind to `tabSwitcher.raceTabIndex` for consistent state management
- **HomeView Navigation Enhancement**: 
  - Updated "View All" button from generic `tabSwitcher.switchToTab(2)` to precise `tabSwitcher.switchToRaceTab(section: 2)`
  - Enables direct navigation to My Races section (index 2) rather than default Featured races

### **Join Race Button Standardization**
**Implementation**: Unified join button styling and behavior across all race detail views for consistent user experience
- **Simplified Color Logic**: Eliminated inconsistent gray styling for insufficient tickets
  - **Eligible Races**: Consistent accent color gradient (green) for all joinable races
  - **Ineligible Races**: Unified red gradient for all rejection cases (rank requirements, insufficient tickets, etc.)
- **Enhanced Visual Treatment**:
  - **Background**: LinearGradient with color-matched shadows for depth
  - **Eligible**: Accent gradient with prominent 8px shadow in accent color at 0.3 opacity
  - **Ineligible**: Red gradient with subtle 4px shadow in red color at 0.2 opacity
- **Typography Enhancement**: Changed font weight to `.semibold` for improved readability and prominence
- **Opacity States**: Eligible buttons at full opacity (1.0), ineligible at 0.8 for clear disabled indication
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `joinButtonColor` computed property and consolidated all styling logic
- **Icon Consistency**: Maintained existing logic for status-based icon selection (`play.fill` for live, `person.badge.plus` for upcoming)
- **Button Text Logic**: Preserved existing dynamic text system ("Join Race Now" for live races, error messages for ineligible states)

### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Build Stability**: Resolved all compilation errors enabling smooth development and testing workflow
- **Input Efficiency**: Universal keyboard dismissal reduces friction in form interactions
- **Race Discovery**: Enhanced home screen promotes user's committed races while maintaining Featured race prominence
- **Navigation Precision**: Specific section targeting improves workflow efficiency for race management
- **Visual Consistency**: Standardized join button treatment eliminates user confusion about race eligibility
- **Accessibility**: Consistent visual feedback for button states and clear keyboard dismissal options

### **Technical Implementation Details**
- **Error Resolution**: Applied DragGesture syntax corrections and cleaned redundant variable references
- **State Management**: Extended TabSwitcher with race section control while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Component Reuse**: Leveraged existing RacePreviewCard components for consistent upcoming races display
- **Conditional UI**: Smart display logic for upcoming races card based on user's joined race status
- **Gesture Recognition**: Implemented proper gesture conflict resolution for keyboard dismissal
- **Button Styling**: Consolidated visual styling logic using LinearGradient and shadow combinations
