# This file contains the creative guidliens for the app, Oarena, we are building.

# UI guidelines:
- Coded for native iOS, using SwiftUI elements and Apple SF icons.
- Fun, sporty vibe with warm colors, shaded elements, and engaging language and icons.
- Utilize a card-based UI approach for cleanliness and simplicity.
- Color scheme is described below.
- Ensure UI elements have sufficient padding/spacing above and below them such that elements do not feel crowded or out-of-place. Everything should look very deliberate and thought out.
- Use Icons in place of text where the icon clearly communicates the element's function. Otherwise, try to combine icons and text, especially for buttons.

# UX Guidlines:
- Engage the user, but don't be overbearing.
- Incredibly intuitive - everything feels like it is exactly where it needs to be and you know exactly what it does. This requires creative and thoughtful UI elements.

# App color palette (XML):
<palette>
  <color name="Midnight green" hex="084c61" r="8" g="76" b="97" />
  <color name="Payne's gray" hex="4f6d7a" r="79" g="109" b="122" />
  <color name="Verdigris" hex="56a3a6" r="86" g="163" b="166" />
  <color name="Cinnabar" hex="e55934" r="229" g="89" b="52" />
  <color name="Pumpkin" hex="fa7921" r="250" g="121" b="33" />
</palette>
- Be sure to pick a primary/base color (which should be non-onvasive), and user the other colors as supporting colors (e.g. highlights and buttons).
- Always ensure consistent use of the color scheme across app screens i.e. similar buttons/cards should have the same colors.
